# Uber-ride-Analysis
# 🚖 Uber Ride Data Analysis

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber ride data. Using Python and data visualization libraries, we uncover insights about ride patterns, demand cycles, and operational hotspots that can help improve decision-making.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Time series analysis of Uber rides (by day, hour, and month)
- Peak demand identification across different bases
- Visualization of ride distribution trends
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques

## 📂 Files in This Repo

- `uber_ride_data_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full EDA process
- `README.md` – Documentation and overview of the project

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨

## 📈 Key Insights

- Weekdays, especially during rush hours, show the highest ride volume
- Certain bases dominate ride distribution depending on the time of day
- Monthly trends highlight changing customer behavior over time

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Practice with real-world time-series and categorical data
- Gained experience in data visualization and pattern recognition
- Developed skills in data wrangling and feature engineering
